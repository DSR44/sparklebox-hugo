**SnapSpells** are quick, magical shifts you can activate anytime. Each one begins with a visualization — not just a thought, but a felt scene you step into.

Like Neville’s ladder technique, the secret is to **see yourself doing it**. Not imagining as a third person — but living it with your senses. That’s when the shift begins.

### ✨ Spell 1: The Door Shift

You stand in a dim room — heavy, foggy. There’s a glowing door ahead. You walk to it and **open it fast**. Light floods your chest as you take one step through. You inhale a new air. You feel yourself shifting.

*Mantra:* **“I have walked out of it. It no longer belongs to me.”**

### ✨ Spell 2: The Energy Slam

You raise your hands and **slam them down through your aura**, brushing away static energy. Each movement breaks the old spell. You whisper “off” as it clears.

*Mantra:* **“I am clearing this field. My space is my choice.”**

### ✨ Spell 3: The Cold Water Catch

You turn the faucet. **You cup the water** in your palms, press it to your face. You feel the shift — immediate, refreshing, present. You’ve caught the moment. It’s yours now.

*Mantra:* **“I am clear. I am here. I’m back in my body now.”**
