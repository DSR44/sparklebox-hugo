### On Loneliness in a Numb World

    Your browser does not support the audio element.

Yesterday I scrolled past two short clips. I don’t spend much time on social feeds, but sometimes I look in, just to see the pulse of the world. One clip was of a coach speaking into the camera after turning off the TV: *“You cannot make it in life without people around you—without human connection, family, friends, support.”* Yet the comments underneath told a different story. Comment after comment whispered the same truth: *“But I have no one. I live alone. I can’t find connection.”* An entire thread of solitude—confessions of people who never chose to be alone, but who find themselves trapped in it.

The second clip was from a man mourning a simpler humanity. He missed children playing outside. He missed cookouts, neighbors leaning over fences, conversations flowing without screens between them. He asked: *what happened to us?*

I feel this too. Even within families, there is distance now. It feels energetic—as if most humans live suspended in a kind of limbo. A spiritual limbo. People are physically here, yet emotionally and soulfully absent. Life passes many by without them realizing, numbed by overwhelming input, by performance pressure, by the fear that is sold as the baseline of our existence.

We think we are socializing through screens, but even there people are retreating. Metrics no longer mirror true connection. We scroll but do not feel. We post but do not touch. Loneliness grows—even in crowded rooms. It is not only about being alone, it is about feeling unseen, unheard, un-understood.

I am not here to call myself a seer, but I am deeply empathic. And what I sense is that most people are caught between two forces: the life they wish to live, and the image they think the world demands from them. Between authenticity and performance. Between soul and system. And in that tension, many collapse into silence—life slipping by unfulfilled.

This is not only social. It is spiritual. True spirituality cannot be pre-packaged, printed into slogans, or outsourced to another. Spirituality is not the endless feed of affirmations we are told to recite—it is an experience that must arise within. When the soul is bypassed, the body works, the mind races, but the spirit grows numb. That numbness is the loneliness beneath all loneliness.

So what can we do? Begin by being honest—with yourself, with those around you. Speak how you feel, even if awkward. Remember: when one person dares to speak, many silently agree. You are not the only one. You are never the only one.

Loneliness will continue to rise unless we return to presence, to real communication, to sovereignty of self. And sovereignty begins with perception—with self-concept. How you see yourself drives everything. If you perceive that others will reject you, it is already you rejecting yourself. If you reclaim the truth that your soul is the power force of your own world, then you will begin to align with the life that belongs to you.

Loneliness whispers, *“nobody cares.”* But what if everyone is whispering that? What if, in reality, everybody cares, but nobody dares? Perhaps the first step is to dare.

✨ You are not imagining this. You are not alone. The Mirror is open. Return when you need to remember.
