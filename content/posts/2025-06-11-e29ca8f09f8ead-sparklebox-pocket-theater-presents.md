### **“The Love I Sought Was Always Mine”**

*Act VII – A Monologue of Longing and Return*

### 🩰 *Scene Opens.*

![](/ddoorr-1024x775.jpg)

The stage is dim. A rose window bleeds moonlight through soft velvet drapes.
A chair sits center stage, empty but waiting.
A single candle glows. A journal lies closed beside it.
Then — a figure steps forward. Cloaked in longing. Crowned in quiet ache.
She speaks — not to an audience, but to her own forgotten heart.

### 🎙️ *Monologue:*

![](/bar-1024x775.jpg)

**“Where is the love that calleth my name?
I have wandered, bare-footed through hearts,
Lain beneath stars, lips parted in hope—
And yet, no arms did know my shape.”**

**“I sought him in glances,
In promises swaddled in silk and silence.
In the hollow warmth of near-enoughs.
But each touch turned to mist.”**

**“Then did I wake — not with bitterness,
But with a truth more fierce than flame:
The love I sought in others
Was but the love I was starving to give myself.”**

**“O foolish heart! To wait for a mirror
To tell thee thou art worthy of thy own reflection.
Each ache I placed in another’s hands
Was a letter I had sealed, but never read aloud.”**

**“Now, by moon’s vow and breath anew,
I claim the one love that shall not flee:
Mine own.”**

**“No knight. No lover. No salvation needed.
I am the one who stays.”**

The candle flickers. The rose window fades.
She lays a hand upon her chest —
A gesture of promise. Of return.

### 🎭 *The Curtain Falls.*

And somewhere, beneath the silence,
you remember:
*The greatest love is not found —
It is remembered within.*
