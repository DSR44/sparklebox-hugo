*(A poetic tale of transformation and hope)*

Beneath the velvet canopy of a moonlit forest, where stars fell like scattered jewels through the swaying silhouettes of ancient oaks, there lay a weathered stone bench, cradled by time itself. The air quivered, alive with a quiet magic, as if the forest held its breath, awaiting its nightly symphony to begin.

Elysia sat upon that bench, her delicate figure draped in shadows. Her raven black hair tumbled like a waterfall of midnight down her back, reflecting the soft gleam of silver moonlight. Her hands, folded tightly in her lap, trembled with the weight of invisible burdens. A sorrow had taken root within her, deep as tree roots that clutch the earth, and it seemed the very night mourned with her.

Yet amid the stillness, a flicker of light stirred in the underbrush, a soft pulse that broke through the darkness like dawn teasing the horizon. Emerging gracefully, Lyrian, the Mystic Guide, stepped forth. The bird's form shimmered with an otherworldly glow, her feathers like woven opals, shifting in color as if capturing the rhythm of time itself. Each step she took toward Elysia seemed to mark the cadence of a song yet unsung.

Lyrian perched beside her, tilting her luminous head to meet Elysia’s downturned gaze with an unsettling yet comforting intensity. The forest hummed faintly, its rustling leaves forming a prelude, and then Lyrian began to sing.

The first note was like a ripple in still water, soft and measured, yet carrying infinite depth. Her voice cascaded gently, a stream of sound that ebbed and flowed, touching every corner of the forest. It was the voice of centuries, ageless and eternal, layered with nuances no earthly instrument could replicate. The bird’s song held tones that surged like rushing rivers and whispered like winds brushing wild meadows.

It was sorrow; it was hope; it was the fragile poignancy of existence shimmering into melody. The music wrapped itself around Elysia with tender insistence, filling the cracks in her aching heart. Lyrian’s feathers, already radiant, began to glow brighter, emitting waves of soft light that painted the forest floor in hues of soft gold and silver. The trees stood statuesque, their branches bathed in faint luminescence, bearing witness to this sacred serenade.

The song wove stories into the night, tales of lives lost and found, of stars that never dimmed, and of shadows that always yielded to light. It whispered directly to the parts of Elysia that she had long buried, coaxing forth her hidden grief like vapor rising from the earth. Each note curled into the air like a prayer, an offering to something timeless and unseen.

Elysia slowly raised her head, her tear-filled eyes meeting Lyrian's gentle yet piercing gaze. She felt her breath hitch, as though the very fabric of her being was being unraveled and rewoven by the song. The bird’s song invited her into a mystery, one that she had never dared to confront.

“I hear you,” Elysia whispered, her voice shaking and thin like an autumn leaf. “I feel you.”

The melody shifted, softening into a lullaby of light. Lyrian spread her wings, and with a single motion, the glow around her pulsed outward like a gentle wave washing over the forest. Each beam of light seemed to reach into the crevices of Elysia’s soul, offering not just comfort but a quiet, resolute strength.

The woman's clenched fists loosened at last, her hands opening like petals at sunrise. Elysia exhaled deeply, the kind of breath that came from a place she hadn’t reached in years, and the weight she carried seemed to lift, dispersing into the illuminated night sky.

When Lyrian’s song fell silent, the air itself seemed transformed. The silence that followed wasn’t empty but thrummed with the promise of possibilities yet to come. Lyrian's small form shimmered faintly in the residual glow, her mission complete, her gaze still cradling Elysia with infinite tenderness.

The forest exhaled with her as night continued its quiet vigil. And though the Mystic Guide had leapt gently into the air, her opalescent form disappearing into the star-stippled sky, Lyrian’s song remained etched into Elysia’s heart. It was now hers, a sacred melody she could carry forward as a reminder that even the darkest nights hold glimmers of peace.

Elysia stood from the bench, her lips curving into the faintest smile. Above her, the moon smiled back, as if it had always known.

## **Mantra**

“Even in the darkest night, the melody of healing sings softly in my soul. I open my heart to its quiet magic.”

## **Journal Prompt**

Sit still and imagine Lyrian’s song filling the space around you. What emotions, memories, or thoughts rise as you listen within? Write them down without judgment. Explore how this “song” might be a reflection of your own healing process, and consider what next step the melody invites you to take.
