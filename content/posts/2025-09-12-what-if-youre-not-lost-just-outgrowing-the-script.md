What If You’re Not Lost — Just Outgrowing the Script?

There’s a kind of unrest I’ve carried for as long as I can remember.  
I was one of those kids who always felt like something was... off.  
Not in a dramatic way. Just in the quiet, private sense that the way we live — the way society is structured, the way we chase things — never made real sense to me.

I used to ask questions that made people uncomfortable.  
Eventually, I learned not to say much at all.

And so I adapted.  
Played the role.  
Lived “normally.”

But inside, I was always wandering.

For 16 years, I worked as a flight attendant for a major international airline.  
I traveled the world — literally.  
But the truth is, I wasn’t just collecting passport stamps or chasing aesthetics. I was chasing a feeling. Something like a purpose. Something like a task I hadn’t been told but somehow knew I needed to complete.

It wasn’t restlessness.  
It was more like... a whisper.  
A feeling that I was supposed to figure something out.

I spent years reading, searching, comparing.  
I went through books, teachings, scholars, spiritual texts — from *The Secret* to *The Flower of Life* by Drunvalo Melchizedek.  
From the Torah to the Bible to temples tucked in distant corners of the world.

What I found was a pattern.  
A kind of rhythm behind existence.  
Everything in this world — from breath to architecture to time — moves in synchronicity. So it must be following a language.  
Not a spoken language.  
But a **pattern of creation**.

That was my first real realization:  
There is a structure beneath all of this.  
Geometry. Harmony. Frequency.

But something still didn’t click.

Despite all that knowledge — I still didn’t *feel* it.  
It was words, diagrams, ideas.  
It wasn’t embodied truth.  
It didn’t settle into my nervous system.

That came later.

And I wish I could tell you it arrived peacefully.  
But it didn’t.

I had an accident that left me unable to walk for a while.  
I won’t go into detail. That’s not the point.

The point is:  
When you can’t move, when you’re not part of the "moving world" — the roles fall off.  
You see things differently.  
You see *yourself* differently.

Much like traveling to a new country shows you who you are in unfamiliar space — being broken and still shows you who you are without your normal roles, routines, or distractions.

And that… that’s when it started to make sense.

I began to understand that the **external** world isn’t what holds the answers.  
It’s only a mirror.  
And the real work — the real truth — begins in your inner dialogue.

That’s when I stumbled into the teachings of **Neville Goddard**, **Florence Scovel Shinn**, and others who pointed toward the simplest but most radical idea:

> The world outside only exists because **you** are perceiving it.

If I’m not looking at the table in front of me, it doesn’t matter whether it exists.  
If I don’t observe the person walking past, they have no influence on my reality.  
Which means: **I am the observer, the projector, the orchestrator.**

Let me say it plainly:

**We manipulate our own world constantly — through thought, feeling, and assumption.**

And most of us don’t even realize we’re doing it.

We chase this thing called *purpose* as if it’s something to be found in the outside world — a title, a job, a partner, a path.

But what if purpose is something that *emerges* only when you become fully yourself?

What if it’s not a task — but a byproduct of alignment?

I still don’t know my full purpose.  
But I stopped making that feel like a failure.

Because the more I try to "find it," the more I’m chasing a ghost.  
Purpose isn’t a destination.  
It’s something that reveals itself as I stay honest with who I am, how I feel, and what I create.

For me, that means using tools — but adding my own nuance.  
Injecting myself into every image, every blog post, every sound, every Sparklebox spell.

*My ideas. My colors. My thoughts. My rhythm.*

That gives me peace. That makes me feel like I’m not wasting time — even if I still don’t have it all figured out.

I’ve learned to pause when I feel bad and ask:

> Do I actually want to feel this way?

Most of the time, the answer is no.

And if I dig deeper, I find that the reason I’m sad or off is something ridiculous — like someone didn’t text me back, or someone I liked didn’t respond the way I hoped.

And then I remember:  
That’s a **cyber world interaction**.  
It’s not real.  
It’s not physical, in-front-of-me, human-time real.

And I take my power back.

That’s the point of all of this.

Not just to feel “better.”  
But to stop giving your energy away to things that don’t even exist — things you created, fears you repeated, illusions you empowered.

I don’t have the full answers.  
But I know this:

  - Reality responds to **you**.

  - The world is shaped by what you assume.

  - Every thought is a frequency that either empowers or imprisons you.

So the question isn’t: *What’s my purpose?*  
The question is: *What am I repeating? What am I reacting to? What am I allowing to define me?*

If any of this resonates with you… you’re not alone.

And if you want to go deeper into the language of self-concept, thought rewiring, and soft reality design,  
you can explore my [**Base Class series**](https://sparklebox.blog/tag/sparklebox-base-class/) or the [**Dream Toolkit**](https://sparklebox.blog/%E2%9C%A8-the-dreamtoolkit-%E2%9C%A8/).

They were born from these realizations — and I think you might find something there that whispers back to you.

**✨ Trust your nuance. It’s enough.
