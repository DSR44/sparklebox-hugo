# The Secret to Feeling Like "That Girl" (Even if You're a Hot Mess)

Weâ€™ve all caught ourselves doom-scrolling on Instagram, staring at perfect, sunlit breakfasts and plant-filled interiors, wondering one simple thing: ***how on earth does she have her life together?***

Hereâ€™s the truth that nobodyâ€™s sayingâ€”**you don't have to wake up at 5 AM, run 10 miles**, or own six variations of a silk robe to be "that girl." Wellness isnâ€™t about perfection; itâ€™s about creating habits that make you feel refreshed, confident, and in control.

If youâ€™ve been struggling to find balance, this guide will walk you through simple, actionable steps to live the life you deserveâ€”without tossing your messy bun or morning snoozes to the curb. And donâ€™t worry, humor and relatable struggles are included. (Spoiler alert: I tried drinking celery juice every morning. Iâ€™d rather stick to *water*.)

## What Does "That Girl" Really Mean?

Before we jump into the how, letâ€™s talk about the *what*. Being "that girl" isnâ€™t about meeting someone elseâ€™s aesthetic standardâ€”itâ€™s about becoming the best version of yourself. For some, it's about productivity and positivity; for others, it's matching vibes with iced coffee and a journal close at hand.

The secret? **Small, consistent habits that add up to a bigger, better YOU.** The point isnâ€™t to overhaul your entire life overnight. Instead, weâ€™re focusing on curating habits that actually work for you.

## Why Self-Care (Actually) Matters

**You canâ€™t pour from an empty cup, right? Self-care isnâ€™t selfish**â€”whether youâ€™re building a chaotic startup, running after toddlers, or figuring out your next big move, taking care of yourself lays the foundation for balance and success. Itâ€™s about nourishing your mind, body, and soulâ€”and yes, sometimes dressing up for no reason just to feel fab.

## Step 1 // Ditch the "Perfect Morning" Myth

You donâ€™t need to wake up at 4 AM to meditate, workout, read a novel, and meditate again. One intentional habit is better than forcing yourself to do five things you secretly hate.

### Try this:

- Begin with just **one habit.** Maybe itâ€™s chugging a glass of water first thing (your body will love you for it). Apps like **Habitica** or **Productive** will keep you motivated with trackers and reminders.

- Check out **Self-Care IRL on YouTube** (she keeps it real about making sustainable habits).

ðŸ’¡ Need a water bottle that screams "that girl aesthetic"? This [minimalist, motivational ](https://amazon.com/motivational-water-bottle)[water bottle ](https://amzn.to/42HI3NK) keeps you stylish *and* hydrated.

## Step 2 // Find *Your* Wellness Routine

Forget one-size-fits-all advice. Donâ€™t like running? Dance. Not into journaling? Do voice notes. Your "wellness" should feel goodâ€”not like a punishment.

### Check in with yourself:

- **What feels natural?** Start with small tweaks to what you *already do*. Swap your post-lunch slump TikTok session for a 5-minute stretch instead.

- **Explore what clicks:** Maybe itâ€™s a [scented bath](https://amzn.to/4aNO9y9) or an evening meditation with the **Headspace** app. Experiment freely!

## Step 3 // Create a Weekly "Hot Mess Recovery Day"

Newsflash! Not every day is going to feel organized or Instagrammableâ€”and thatâ€™s TOTALLY fine. Sometimes, the best self-care is taking a day to reset.

**Enter the "Hot Mess Recovery Day"**:

This non-negotiable weekly detox day helps you recharge without guilt. The to-do list? Relaxing, recharging, and reconnecting with yourself.

### Recovery day must-haves:

- Declutter your mind with a brain-dump journaling session. (Check out the **Five Minute Journal**!)

- Prep a 3-item "win" list for the week ahead.

- Netflix, face-masks, and calling a friend totally count as wellness. *Balance.*

## Step 4 // Upgrade Your Everyday Essentials

You deserve to feel bougie even when life is busy. The right tools? Game-changers.

### What to snag:

- **Coffee & Chill** Set-up:

Canâ€™t start your day without coffee? Level it up with the [Frothi Milk Frother.*](https://amzn.to/4aVxCIn) (*Affiliate alert! Thank me later.)

- **Workout, but Make it Cute**:

Invest in comfy, cute workout gear your body actually likes (hello, Lululemon discount sales!).

Find your groove with YouTubers like **Pamela Reif** (for insane vibes) or **Move With Nicole** (if Pilates is your thing).

## Step 5 // Build Your "That Girl" Capsule

**You donâ€™t need 72 skin-care items or an influencer closet. *Quality over quantity,* babe.**

### What to keep handy:

- **Go-to outfit:** Whether itâ€™s leggings and a [crop top ](https://amzn.to/3WTrVVz)or [high-waisted jeans ](https://amzn.to/3CtQFNq)and a [blazer](https://amzn.to/4hqubvW)â€”find that one fit that makes you feel unstoppable.

- **Planner or Just Post-Its:** Organizing your schedule doesnâ€™t have to be complicated. Color-coded stickies work just as well as pricey planners.

- **3-Minute Makeup Hack:** Save time with beauty must-haves like **Glossierâ€™s Boy Brow** or **Charlotte Tilburyâ€™s Glow Wand**.

They say youâ€™re the average of the 5 people you spend the most time withâ€”so curate that energy ðŸ’«. (Even digitally.)

Start with one change, download an app, or snag that water bottle (because healthy AND cute matters). Make life your own vibe, unapologetically. Oh, and when in doubt? Add a face mask.
