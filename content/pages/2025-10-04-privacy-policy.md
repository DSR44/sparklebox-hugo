## Who We Are

Our website address is: [https://sparklebox.blog](https://sparklebox.blog).

Sparklebox is a creative wellness platform founded by Elle Vida, offering poetic digital downloads, affirmations, and AI-inspired rituals through the Sparklebox Bazaar. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.

## Comments

When visitors leave comments on blog posts, we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help with spam detection. An anonymized string created from your email address may be provided to the Gravatar service to check if you are using it. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

## Media

If you upload images to the website (e.g., profile photo or comment image), please avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS). Visitors to the site can download and extract location data from images on the site.

## Cookies

We use cookies to improve your browsing experience, remember your preferences, and provide secure login and checkout sessions for the Sparklebox Bazaar.

  - **Login cookies** – keep you signed in for up to two weeks if you select “Remember Me.”

  - **Checkout cookies** – used by Easy Digital Downloads to securely manage your shopping cart and payment process.

  - **Analytics cookies** – anonymous tracking used to understand what content readers enjoy most.

You can clear or disable cookies anytime in your browser settings.

## Embedded Content from Other Websites

Posts and pages on this site may include embedded content (e.g., videos, images, music players, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves exactly as if the visitor had visited the other website. Those websites may collect data about you, use cookies, and monitor your interaction with their embedded content.

## Who We Share Your Data With

We do not sell or rent your data. Data is shared only with trusted third-party services that help us operate this site securely:

  - **Easy Digital Downloads** – for handling secure purchases and digital delivery.

  - **Payment processors** – such as PayPal or Stripe, used to process transactions. Sparklebox does not store your credit card details.

  - **Email services** – if you subscribe to Sparklebox updates, your email is stored in a secure email marketing system (e.g., MailerLite or ConvertKit).

## How Long We Retain Your Data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely to allow follow-up replies to appear automatically. For customers who make a purchase, we retain the billing and order information required for tax and accounting purposes for up to seven years.

## What Rights You Have Over Your Data

You can request an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you’ve provided. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you, except for data we must keep for legal, administrative, or security reasons.

## Where Your Data Is Sent

Visitor comments and contact form submissions may be checked through an automated spam detection service. Payments are processed securely through PayPal or Stripe via encrypted HTTPS connections.
