### **Navigating the 75 Soft Challenge: A Beginner’s Guide to a Balanced Wellness Journey**

Finding Success in Simplicity
You’ve probably scrolled past it on TikTok—the hashtag #75SoftChallenge, reeling in millions of views and skyrocketing in popularity. Unlike its tough-love sibling, the [75 Hard Challenge](https://andyfrisella.com/pages/75hard-info), this gentler alternative has captured the hearts of wellness seekers who believe a more achievable and balanced approach is the key to building sustainable habits.

If you’re new to fitness challenges or looking for a method that fits your beginner-friendly, mentally balanced values, the 75 Soft Challenge might be what you’re looking for.
This guide will help you uncover the essentials of the 75 Soft Challenge, explore its benefits, and decide if it’s the right step for your wellness journey.

### **What is the 75 Soft Challenge?**

At its core, the [75 Soft Challenge](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness/75-soft-challenge) revolves around consistency, manageable goals, and fostering a lifestyle you can stick to. It’s a functional roadmap for personal well-being with equal parts fitness, nutrition, and mindfulness.

**Here’s how it works:**

- **Daily Exercise (45 minutes):** Choose an activity you enjoy! Whether it’s a brisk walk through your neighborhood or a yoga session, the focus is on movement—not high-intensity exhaustion.

- **Follow a Balanced Diet:** Unlike restrictive meal plans, the challenge encourages mindful eating. Focus on **whole, nutrient-dense foods** (think [CDC nutrition guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/healthy_eating/index.html)) while allowing flexibility for life’s small pleasures.

- **Stay Hydrated:** Aim for half your body weight in ounces of water daily.

- **Read for Growth:** Dedicate 10+ minutes to reading for self-reflection or curiosity.

The simplicity of these rules makes the 75 Soft Challenge **approachable for anyone**—whether you’re juggling work, parenting, or just starting your fitness journey.

### **How It Differs from 75 Hard**

The original [75 Hard Challenge](https://andyfrisella.com/pages/75hard-info) is famously intense: strict diets, two daily workouts, no cheat days, and no alcohol. It’s rooted in mental toughness—but overwhelming for many.

The 75 Soft Challenge swaps rigidity for **flexibility and balance**:

- Enjoy a glass of wine or take rest days.

- Focus on **sustainable progress over perfection**.

This adaptability makes it a better fit for **long-term lifestyle changes**, especially for beginners.

### **Why It’s Trending**

The challenge has exploded on [TikTok](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/wellness-trends-2023) as the antidote to unsustainable trends. Its rise aligns with a cultural shift toward **mental health and self-care**:

- **Realistic Goals:** Creators share how 75 Soft fits into real life—celebrating small wins like “I drank more water!”

- **Encouragement Over Perfection:** Missing a workout doesn’t erase progress.

As [Psychology Today notes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/202203/set-realistic-goals-mental-health), achievable goals reduce burnout and boost mental well-being.

### **The Benefits of 75 Soft**

- **Consistency is Key:** Research from [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3505409/) shows habits take ~66 days to form—75 days is the perfect start.

- **Better Physical + Mental Health:** Pair movement with mindfulness (like reading) to stay engaged.

- **Improved Time Management:** Short daily resets boost productivity.

- **Stronger Mindset:** Small victories build confidence and clarity.

### **Cautions and Considerations**

- **Personalize Your Plan:** Swap workouts to match your fitness level.

- **Avoid Overexertion:** Take rest days—it’s about consistency, not punishment.

- **Consult Professionals** if you have health conditions or dietary needs.

### **Balance Over Perfection**

The 75 Soft Challenge celebrates **steadiness, not instant results**. Leave perfection at the door and focus on feeling good daily.
