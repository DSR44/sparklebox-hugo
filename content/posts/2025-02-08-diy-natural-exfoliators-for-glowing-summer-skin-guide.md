## 🌿 The Two Types of Exfoliation (And Which One You Need)

Before you jump into creating exfoliators, it's helpful to know the two main types of exfoliation—chemical and mechanical. Here’s how they work and which might be right for you.

### **1️⃣ Chemical Exfoliation**

Chemical exfoliation removes dead skin cells using acids, enzymes, or active natural ingredients. It’s great for those with sensitive skin, as there’s no harsh scrubbing involved.

**Top Natural Ingredients for DIY Chemical Exfoliation:**

- **Lemon Juice 🍋**

Rich in vitamin C and citric acid, lemon juice brightens dull skin and evens skin tone.

- **Apple Cider Vinegar 🍏**

Balances pH levels and provides mild exfoliation while soothing your skin.

- **Yogurt 🥛**

Contains lactic acid, which gently renews the skin's surface and hydrates.

✨ **Trending Now:** Probiotic-based DIY exfoliators! Use fermented skincare ingredients like [**kombucha**](https://amzn.to/4jRJoYg) to boost your skin's microbiome.

### **2️⃣ Mechanical (Physical) Exfoliation**

Mechanical exfoliation uses textures—like scrubs or brushes—to buff away dead skin cells. If you prefer a hands-on approach, this might be more your style.

**Top Textured Ingredients for DIY Scrubs:**

- **Coffee Grounds ☕**

Caffeine firms the skin while the grounds provide natural scrubbing power.

- **Turmeric & Rice Powder 🌾**

Boosts your glow with anti-inflammatory properties and gentle exfoliation.

- **Oatmeal 🌾**

Perfect for soothing sensitive or irritated skin.

✅ **Trending Now:** Natural enzyme scrubs made from papaya or pineapple extract offer a blend of physical and chemical exfoliation for a double-duty effect!
