There was once a sculptor who could hear stone whisper.

Not in language, exactly —
but in silence.
He felt what was hidden within each block: the curve that wished to be seen,
the fracture that begged to remain untouched.

He lived in a pale city of academies and vaulted ceilings,
where young artists were taught how to create what had already been accepted.
Angels with safe faces. Statues of war.
Replicas of replicas of dreams not their own.

They called him gifted.
They gave him titles.
They assigned him work — *“Shape this in the tradition of Formus,”*
*“Chisel that with the weight of Imperial doctrine.”*

And for a while, he obeyed.

But at night —
when the city slipped into its candlelit hush —
he would return to his attic studio, where a single block of uncommissioned marble waited.

He never touched it.

Not yet.

He would sit in front of it, some nights for hours,
his fingers twitching against the chisel.
In his mind, he saw what no one had asked for:

A figure erupting from the stone, half-born and defiant.
Not a saint, not a general, not a god.
But something **new**.
Something **whole**.

The years wore on.

He tried to bury the dream beneath praise.
He conformed.
He was published, awarded, paid.

And yet the untouched marble in his attic grew louder.
Every time he passed it, it pulsed. Not visually — spiritually.
It was waiting.

Waiting for him to stop asking for permission.

When the final commission came —
a colossal monument for the city’s centennial —
he was told, *“Make it strong. Make it holy. Make it familiar.”*

Instead, he made **her**.

The unnamed form he had always seen in dreams —
arms stretched not upward but *outward*,
mouth open not in prayer but in song,
eyes carved with wildness and mercy and a geometry not known to man.

He unveiled it in the square at sunrise.
And by sunset, they had removed it.

He was stripped of his position,
his studio,
his name in the halls.

The city did not tolerate mystery.
They called his work “unfitting,” “blasphemous,”
“too much of nothing.”

He wandered after that.
No map, no patrons.
Just hands and vision and wind and earth.
Years passed like water through open hands.

And one morning, at the edge of a nameless field,
he found a piece of river stone.

He carried it to a hill.
And began again.

What emerged this time was not a figure,
but a shape no one had ever sculpted before.

Not sacred, not profane.

Not masculine, not feminine.

Not holy, not heretical.

Only **true.**

And when he finished, he did not unveil it.
He sat beside it.
And breathed.

Because he had learned:
He was never meant to sculpt for worship.
He was meant to sculpt for **remembering**.

### 🌌 Closing Whisper:

I am not here to be molded by hands I do not know.
I am not here to perform divinity through obedience.
I am here to shape the unseen.
To carve the cosmos from the silence inside me.
I am not the image.
I am the source.
