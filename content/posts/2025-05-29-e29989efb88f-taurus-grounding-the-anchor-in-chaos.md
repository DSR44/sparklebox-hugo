🌍 *Oracle Growth Series | Dreamweaver Tales – Day 2*

### 🪨 **Tale: The Keeper of the Grounded Flame**

When the stars fractured and the winds turned wild, it was not the swift who endured, but the still.

They called her **The Anchor Bearer** — forged not in fire, but in **pressure and time**. Beneath collapsing skies and shifting lands, she walked alone, her pace slow and deliberate, each step a vow. Where others ran, she rooted. Where others shouted, she listened.

She did not wield a sword. She **carried a stone** — carved with sacred sigils, etched from the bedrock of old worlds. It pulsed faintly in her hands, heavy with ancestral knowing. With it, she **held the center when chaos surged**, a living axis around which storms exhausted themselves.

The earth spoke to her in vibrations and silences. She knelt often — not to break, but to **feel what others feared to feel**. She buried her bare hands in the soil, not to hide — but to **remember**.

And when the final tower cracked, and the winds screamed for attention, it was she — unmoved — who whispered:

*"Not all power rises. Some sinks in… and holds."*

### 🌌 **Portal Vision: Q2–Q3 Energy for Taurus**

On the other side: not certainty — but **stability from within**.
A quiet force begins to hum beneath your skin.

✨ You begin trusting slow timing over urgency.
✨ You hold your ground — and let what’s not grounded fall.
✨ You stop proving your worth, and start **embodying it**.

### ✨ **Affirmations for Taurus (2025: Becoming the Steady Light)**

🪨 I move at my own sacred pace.
🪨 My presence is an anchor for myself and others.
🪨 I do not chase. I attract through grounded being.
🪨 I am safe to hold steady when the world shifts.

### 🕯️ **Oracle’s Gift**
