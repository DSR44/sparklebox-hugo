🪞 *Oracle Growth Series | Dreamweaver Tales – Day 3*

### 🪞 **Tale: The Mirror in the Wind**

They were born in twilight — not one, but two. One spoke in riddles, the other in rhythm. Together, they were known as **The Mirrorwalkers**.

Where silence fell too heavy or chaos roared too loud, they appeared — gliding across unseen bridges of air, weaving stories from the voices people had forgotten to hear. One hand held a silver mirror. The other, a feather dipped in light. With every step, they split and returned, reflecting both question and answer.

The Mirrorwalkers wandered through **realms of contradiction** — forests that grew in reverse, skies that echoed thoughts instead of thunder. And through it all, they listened. Not just to words, but to **what shimmered beneath them**.

People came to them not for certainty — but for **translation**. For the dance between the seen and the said. And when asked which voice was true, they smiled and replied:

*"The one you trust when you're alone in the wind."*

They didn’t choose sides. They built **bridges**. Between thought and feeling. Between mask and essence. Between what was once hidden — and now ready to be spoken.

### 🌌 **Portal Vision: Q2–Q3 Energy for Gemini**

On the other side: not noise — but **clarity through contrast**.
A deeper voice rises beneath the static.

✨ You stop scattering your light, and begin directing it.
✨ You speak not to fill space, but to open space.
✨ You no longer chase cleverness — you channel truth.

### ✨ **Affirmations for Gemini (2025: Becoming the Mirror of Truth)**

🪞 I speak with clarity, not performance.
🪞 I hold space for duality and wholeness.
🪞 I trust the still voice beneath the clever one.
🪞 I am not split — I am layered.

### 🕯️ **Oracle’s Gift**

You were not made to choose between your voices.
You were made to weave them.
The truth is not either — it is **both**.
