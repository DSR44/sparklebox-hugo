**Oracle’s Growth | Day 8 of 12**

### 📖 **Tale: The Phoenix Cloaked in Shadow**

There once lived a figure known only by the smoke she left behind.

She did not arrive — she *emerged*.
Not from applause, but from ashes.

They called her the Phoenix of the Undercurrent — born under Scorpio’s sign, she was not afraid of endings. She *dared them*. When the world closed in, she walked deeper. When the mirror shattered, she used the shards to carve a new form.

Her magic wasn’t gentle — it was cellular. She burned away what no longer belonged. Again and again.

Yet underneath that flame? Stillness. Power reclaimed. A gaze that said: *“I’ve died before. I’m not afraid to live fully now.”*

> **"You do not transform by pretending to be new — you transform by burning what no longer serves."**

### 🕯️ **Oracle’s Gift**

You were never meant to stay surface-level. Your power is in the plunge. In the willingness to unmake yourself — and choose who rises next.

You do not fear the dark. You *are* the dark that teaches the light how to shine.

### 🌌 **Affirmations for Scorpio’s Path**

- I release what has expired — without fear.

- My power is mine to reclaim, not borrow.

- I trust death is not the end, but the key to rebirth.

- I rise from endings with deeper clarity and grace.
