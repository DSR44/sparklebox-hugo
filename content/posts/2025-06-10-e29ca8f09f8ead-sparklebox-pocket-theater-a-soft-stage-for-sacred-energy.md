#### *Act V — “Fuel the Flame”*

*Lo-Fi Affirmations for June 10*

### 🕯️ *Scene opens.*

![](/opening_scene-1024x775.jpg)

The stage is soft with morning light.
Birdsong hums beneath a lo-fi beat.
A cozy chair sits center stage — threadbare but noble.
A small orange cat naps in the corner, tail flicking with dreams.
A figure enters, cloaked in warmth and quiet fire.

She carries a single match in her hand.
She speaks.

### 🎙️ *Monologue (Affirmations):*

![](/aaa3-1024x775.jpg)

**“I move forward, even in stillness.”**
*Progress doesn’t always make noise.*

**“My energy builds as I trust the process.”**
*What I nurture today shapes tomorrow.*

**“I am allowed to begin again — even now.”**
*Momentum lives in the next breath.*

**“My spark is sacred. I protect it and feed it.”**

**“Even slow fires can forge strong futures.”**

**“I don’t wait for permission to shine.”**
*Today is reason enough.*

**“I rise without needing to roar.”**
*Power can be quiet and unstoppable.*

The match flares — small, golden.
She lights a candle.
The cat opens one eye.
The moment glows, then folds into stillness.

### 🎭 *The curtain falls.*
