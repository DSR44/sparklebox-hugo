There's a version of you that already knows the depth of your own power. You've felt her stir, a whisper in the darkness, a spark in the silence. What if this whisper is not just a call to awaken, but a reminder of the archetypes that have always resided within you, waiting to be embodied?

## The Hidden Mechanism

This is where most people get the concept of archetypes backwards - they believe these are roles to be learned, rather than aspects of the self to be remembered. The part they don't tell you is that these archetypes are not just figures from ancient mythology, but living, breathing energies that reside within every woman. Ancient priestesses understood these energies as aspects of the divine feminine, neuroscience now recognizes them as patterns in the human psyche, and you experience them as the ebbs and flows of your own inner world. For instance, the Maiden's curiosity is what drives your desire for new experiences, the Mother's nurturing is what guides your care for others, and the Wild Woman's ferocity is what fuels your passion and creativity.

Here's what's actually happening: your body is a tuning fork, resonating with the frequencies of these archetypes. When you're in alignment with them, you feel a sense of sovereignty, a sense of being the queen of your own domain. But when you're disconnected, you feel lost, like a ship without a rudder. The good news is that you can start to tune back in, right now. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, repeat the phrase "I remember" to yourself. Allow the sensation of these words to settle in your body, and notice where you feel a sense of recognition, a sense of "yes, this is true."

As you explore these archetypes, you'll begin to notice how they intersect and overlap, like the threads of a rich tapestry. The Maiden's innocence and curiosity inform the Lover's passion and creativity, while the Mother's nurturing and protection ground the Wild Woman's ferocity and freedom. The Mystic's intuition and wisdom guide the Queen's leadership and vision, and the Crone's wisdom and experience illuminate the path for all the other archetypes.

## The 7 Sacred Feminine Archetypes

Let's dive deeper into each of these archetypes, and explore how they can guide you on your journey of remembering your sovereignty.

**1. The Maiden** - Embodies curiosity, new beginnings, spring energy. She is Persephone before the underworld, full of wonder and awe. Her frequency is one of innocence and possibility, reminding you that every day is a chance to start anew. As you attune to the Maiden's energy, notice how your body feels more open, more receptive to new experiences and sensations.

**2. The Mother** - Nurturing, creating, sustaining life. She is Demeter harvesting grain, Isis healing with her wings. Her energy is one of abundance and care, teaching you to nurture yourself and others. As you embody the Mother's energy, feel how your heart expands, filling with compassion and love for all beings.

**3. The Wild Woman** - Unbridled, fierce, and free. She is the storm that clears the air, the fire that forges steel. Her frequency is one of transformation and liberation, reminding you that you have the power to break free from any cage. As you tap into the Wild Woman's energy, notice how your body feels more alive, more connected to your instincts and desires.

**4. The Mystic** - Intuitive, wise, and connected to the mysteries. She is the moon in all its phases, guiding you through the darkness and into the light. Her energy is one of trust and faith, teaching you to listen to your inner voice. As you attune to the Mystic's frequency, feel how your mind expands, filling with wisdom and insight.

**5. The Lover** - Passionate, sensual, and creative. She is Aphrodite rising from the sea, Eros shooting his arrow. Her frequency is one of pleasure and joy, reminding you that life is meant to be savored and enjoyed. As you embody the Lover's energy, notice how your body feels more sensual, more alive to the pleasures of the senses.

**6. The Queen** - Sovereign, wise, and just. She is the throne upon which you sit, the crown that you wear. Her energy is one of leadership and self-respect, teaching you to claim your power and rule your own kingdom. As you tap into the Queen's frequency, feel how your heart fills with confidence and self-worth.

**7. The Crone** - Wise, compassionate, and all-knowing. She is the grandmother who tells the stories, the elder who holds the wisdom. Her frequency is one of integration and completion, reminding you that every end marks a new beginning. As you attune to the Crone's energy, notice how your mind feels more at peace, more accepting of the cycles of life.

## Why You've Been Stuck

You've been doing things the way you thought you were supposed to, following the rules and playing the roles that society has assigned to you. But actually, this has been a disservice to your true nature. What you call "people-pleasing" is actually a cry from your Maiden, longing to break free from the expectations of others. What you call "self-doubt" is actually a whisper from your Mystic, guiding you to trust your own inner wisdom. The real sovereignty isn't about external validation; it's about internal recognition of your own power and worth.

## The Real Method

The alchemy of embodying these archetypes is not about becoming someone new, but about remembering who you've always been. It's about tuning into the frequencies that reside within you, and allowing them to guide you on your journey. This is not a linear process, but a spiral one - you'll return to each archetype again and again, deepening your understanding and embodiment of their energies. As you do, you'll notice how your body feels more grounded, more connected to the earth and its rhythms. You'll feel how your heart expands, filling with compassion and love for all beings. And you'll know, in the depths of your soul, that you are the queen of your own domain, sovereign and free.

## Your Practice

**1. The Recognition** - Take a moment to notice which archetype is calling to you right now. Is it the Maiden's curiosity, the Mother's nurturing, or the Wild Woman's ferocity? Allow yourself to feel the sensation of this energy in your body, and notice how it guides you to take action in your life.

**2. The Transmutation** - Choose an archetype that you feel drawn to, and spend a day embodying its energy. If you choose the Lover, wear something that makes you feel sensual and beautiful. If you choose the Queen, take a moment to sit in stillness, feeling the weight of your crown. As you embody this archetype, notice how your body feels, how your heart expands, and how your mind clarifies.

**3. The Integration** - Take a few moments each day to tune into the frequencies of these archetypes. You can do this by repeating a phrase, such as "I am the Maiden, curious and new," or by visualizing the energy of each archetype in your body. As you do, feel how your body becomes a portal, a gateway to the depths of your own sovereignty.

As you embark on this journey of remembering your sovereignty, remember that it's not about becoming someone new, but about uncovering the wisdom that's always been within you. You're not learning something new; you're remembering what you've always known. Magic isn't something you learn; it's something you stop pretending you don't know. And when you stop pretending, you'll find that you're not just a woman - you're a portal to the divine, a gateway to the mysteries of the universe.
