## 🌠 Introduction:

**Sagittarius cosmic fire** burns like a comet across the skies — untamed, wild, and ever-seeking.
This is the dreamer of distant worlds. The archer whose arrow pierces illusion.

In the **Oracle’s Growth Series**, we now arrive at the ninth gate — a portal lit by firelight and guided by starlight. Sagittarius calls you to expand, to explore, to **risk the known for the vastness of becoming**.

**🔥 Trending Now:** Astrology and cosmic psychology are booming on Pinterest and TikTok — especially dreamlike interpretations of fire signs. According to Brave Search trends, phrases like *"spiritual meaning of Sagittarius,"* *"Sagittarius fire energy,"* and *"oracle expansion rituals"* are up across spiritual blogs and aesthetic zodiac cards.

## 🏹 Oracle’s Tale: *The Archer’s Ember*

In a realm where stars whispered prophecies into flames, lived a wanderer called Sael.
He bore no map, only a quiver of questions and a single torch that never died.

Wherever Sael walked, the ground beneath grew stories — some blazing, others smoldering.
He didn’t chase answers. He chased **truths that sang in firelight**.
On the night of the Red Moon, the Oracle spoke:
*"Those who fear stillness never meet their destiny. Burn through boundaries. Blaze your myth."*

So Sael stood still for the first time, letting the fire speak.
It didn’t roar. It hummed.
And from the embers rose a truth he had long carried:
**“Your freedom is sacred. Your flame is divine.”**

## ✨ Affirmations for Sagittarius

🔹 **“I expand beyond limitation, guided by the fire of my truth.”**
🔹 **“The universe opens where I dare to leap.”**
🔹 **“I trust the path that feels like a spark in my chest.”**

## 🌕 Oracle’s Gift:

*“Your fire is not meant to destroy — it’s meant to illuminate.”*
Let your flame guide others home, but never dim to fit the shadows.
