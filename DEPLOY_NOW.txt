ðŸš€ DEPLOY YOUR SITE IN 30 SECONDS WITH SURGE

Open Terminal and run these commands:

cd /Users/manalbenjabeur/Desktop/Moving_sparklebox_blog/hugo_site
surge public

When it asks:
1. Email: [type your email]
2. Password: [create a password]
3. Domain: Just press ENTER (or type: sparklebox.surge.sh)

That's it! Your site will be LIVE!

It will give you a URL like: https://sparklebox.surge.sh

---

OR, TRY NETLIFY AGAIN:

1. Check your email for Netlify verification
2. Go to app.netlify.com
3. "Deploy manually"
4. Drag the PUBLIC folder (the one I opened in Finder)
5. NOT the hugo_site folder!

---

The PUBLIC folder contains your complete website - just HTML files ready to host anywhere!
