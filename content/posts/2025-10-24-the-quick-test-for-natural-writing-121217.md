Ever notice how some writing just feels off? Like, you're reading something that's supposed to be deep and meaningful, but it sounds like it was written by a robot trying to be spiritual? That's what happens when we forget to write like humans. We get caught up in trying to sound mystical or poetic, and our words end up feeling forced, like we're trying too hard.

I was thinking about this at 3am on Tuesday, lying awake and scrolling through my social media feeds. I stumbled upon a post from a writer I used to admire, and it was like reading a parody of spiritual writing. Every sentence was a cliché, every phrase a predictable attempt to sound profound. It was like they'd taken every buzzword from the spiritual community and mashed them all together into a big mess of meaningless words.

The thing about writing is, it's not about using the right words or phrases. It's not about trying to sound a certain way or fit into a particular mold. It's about being honest, being real, being human. When we write from that place, our words have power. They resonate with people, they touch hearts, they change lives.

But when we try to write like we think we're supposed to, like we're trying to fit into some ideal of what a "spiritual writer" should sound like, our words fall flat. They feel fake, insincere, like we're just trying to manipulate people into feeling a certain way. And that's not what writing is about. Writing is about connection, about community, about sharing our true selves with the world.

So, how do we write naturally? How do we tap into that place of honesty and authenticity, and let our words flow from there? For me, it starts with forgetting about the rules. Forgetting about what we think we're supposed to sound like, and just writing from the heart. It means being willing to be vulnerable, to share our fears and doubts and uncertainties, rather than trying to present some perfect, polished facade.

It means writing in our own voice, rather than trying to imitate someone else's. It means using our own unique perspective, our own experiences and insights, rather than regurgitating what we've read or heard from others. And it means being willing to take risks, to push boundaries, to challenge ourselves and our readers to think differently.

One of my favorite writers, Rumi, was a master of this. His words are like little bombs of truth, exploding in our minds and hearts and challenging us to see the world in a new way. He didn't try to sound spiritual or poetic; he just wrote from his own deep wisdom and experience. And that's what makes his words so powerful, so timeless.

Another writer who inspires me is Clarissa Pinkola Estés. Her book, "Women Who Run With the Wolves," is like a bible for me, a reminder of the power and beauty of the feminine spirit. She writes with such passion and fire, such honesty and vulnerability, that her words feel like a breath of fresh air. She's not trying to fit into some mold or ideal; she's just being herself, fully and completely.

So, what's the quick test for natural writing? For me, it's simple: does it sound like a human wrote it? Does it feel like a real person is speaking to me, rather than some robotic attempt at spirituality? Do the words feel honest and authentic, or do they feel like they're trying too hard?

When we write from the heart, when we write with honesty and vulnerability, our words have the power to touch hearts and change lives. They have the power to inspire and uplift, to challenge and transform. So, let's forget about the rules, and just write. Let's be real, be human, be ourselves. And let our words flow from that place of deep wisdom and connection. 

The thing is, natural writing isn't just about the words we use; it's about the energy we put into them. It's about the intention and the passion behind our writing. When we write with love and care, when we write with the intention of connecting with others, our words feel different. They feel alive, vibrant, full of energy.

And that's what we need more of in the world: writing that feels alive, writing that feels human. Writing that touches our hearts and changes our lives. So, let's take the quick test, and see if our writing passes the test. Let's write from the heart, and let our words flow from that place of deep wisdom and connection. 

For example, instead of saying "As I sit in stillness, I am reminded of the importance of mindfulness," we could say "Mindfulness is like a breath of fresh air - it's what gets me through the tough days." Or, instead of saying "Let us embark on a journey of self-discovery," we could say "I've been on a journey of self-discovery for years, and it's been a wild ride." 

The point is, natural writing is about being real, being honest, being human. It's not about trying to sound a certain way or fit into some ideal; it's about writing from the heart, and letting our words flow from that place of deep wisdom and connection. So, let's take the quick test, and see if our writing passes the test. Let's write from the heart, and let our words change the world. 

In the end, it's not about the words we use, or the way we write. It's about the energy we put into our writing, the intention and the passion behind our words. When we write with love and care, when we write with the intention of connecting with others, our words feel different. They feel alive, vibrant, full of energy. And that's what we need more of in the world: writing that feels alive, writing that feels human. 

So, let's write from the heart, and let our words flow from that place of deep wisdom and connection. Let's be real, be honest, be human. And let our words change the world. One sentence at a time. 

I think that's the key to natural writing: being willing to take risks, to be vulnerable, to share our true selves with the world. It's not always easy, but it's always worth it. When we write from the heart, when we write with honesty and authenticity, our words have the power to touch hearts and change lives. And that's what it's all about. 

In the stillness of the night, when the world is quiet and dark, I feel like I can hear my heart beating. It's a reminder that I'm alive, that I'm human, that I'm connected to something deeper and more meaningful than myself. And that's what I want my writing to be like: a reminder of our shared humanity, a reminder of the beauty and power of the human spirit. 

So, let's write like we're human. Let's write from the heart, and let our words flow from that place of deep wisdom and connection. Let's be real, be honest, be vulnerable. And let our words change the world. One sentence at a time. 

The thing is, writing is a journey, not a destination. It's a process of discovery, of exploration, of growth. And it's okay to not have all the answers, to not know exactly where we're going. Because the truth is, we're all just figuring it out as we go along. And that's what makes writing so beautiful, so powerful: it's a reflection of our shared humanity, our shared struggles and triumphs.

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear. That's what I've found, anyway. When I'm still and quiet, I can hear my heart beating, I can hear the whispers of my soul. And that's when the writing flows, that's when the words come alive. 

So, let's write from the heart, and let our words flow from that place of deep wisdom and connection. Let's be real, be honest, be human. And let our words change the world. One sentence at a time.

So, let's write from the heart, and let our words flow from that
