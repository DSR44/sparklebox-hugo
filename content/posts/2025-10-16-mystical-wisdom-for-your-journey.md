**The Weight of Forgetting: How Your Body Holds the Memories You've Tried to Bury**

Do you ever feel like you're carrying a weight that isn't yours to bear? A heaviness that settles in your chest, a fatigue that clings to your bones, a sense of disconnection from the world around you? It's as if your body is holding onto memories that your mind has tried to forget. And it's not just the big traumas, the ones that leave visible scars. It's the small, everyday betrayals, the whispered lies, the subtle erosions of your sense of self. Your body remembers what your mind has forgotten, and it's time to listen to its whispers.

In ancient Sumerian mythology, the goddess Inanna was said to have descended into the underworld, where she was stripped of her powers and her memories. But as she journeyed back to the world above, she began to remember her true nature, her sovereignty, and her connection to the divine. This myth speaks to the hidden mechanism at play in our own lives: the way our bodies hold the memories we've tried to bury, and the way those memories shape our experiences, our emotions, and our relationships.

Modern neuroscience has confirmed what ancient mystics knew intuitively: that our bodies are storehouses of memory, and that these memories are encoded in our cells, our tissues, and our nervous systems. The concept of "somatic memory" suggests that our bodies retain memories of past experiences, even if our minds have forgotten them. This is why you might feel a physical sensation, a knot in your stomach or a tension in your shoulders, when you encounter a situation or a person that triggers a forgotten memory.

But why have you been stuck in this cycle of forgetting and remembering? Why have you been unable to shake the weight of these buried memories? It's because you've been trying to release them through your mind alone, rather than engaging your body in the process. You've been trying to think your way out of the pain, rather than feeling your way through it. And it's not just about feeling your emotions, but about embodying them, allowing them to move through your body, and releasing them in a way that's authentic and complete.

The real method for releasing these memories is not through mental gymnastics, but through embodied practices that engage your body, your heart, and your soul. This is where the ancient wisdom of the Sacred Feminine comes in: the understanding that our bodies are not just vessels for our minds, but are themselves sources of wisdom, intuition, and guidance. By tuning into your body's wisdom, you can begin to release the memories that have been holding you back, and reclaim your sovereignty, your power, and your connection to the divine.

So, what's your practice? How do you begin to listen to your body's whispers, and release the weight of forgotten memories? Here are a few steps to get you started:

* Take time each day to tune into your body, to feel its sensations, its tensions, and its relaxations. Lie down, sit comfortably, or take a walk, and allow yourself to become aware of your body's inner landscape.
* As you tune in, ask your body what it's trying to tell you. What memories is it holding onto? What emotions is it trying to release? Allow yourself to feel whatever arises, without judgment or resistance.
* Engage in embodied practices that help you release tension and trauma, such as somatic yoga, dance, or other forms of expressive movement. These practices can help you release the physical and emotional residue of forgotten memories, and reclaim your body's natural wisdom and resilience.
* As you release these memories, remember that you're not just releasing pain, but also reclaiming your power, your sovereignty, and your connection to the divine. You're not just healing your body, but also your heart, your mind, and your spirit.

Here's a truth bomb to remember: your body is not just a vessel for your mind, but a portal to your deepest wisdom, your greatest power, and your most profound connection to the world around you. By listening to its whispers, and honoring its wisdom, you can release the weight of forgotten memories, and reclaim your true nature, your sovereignty, and your divine inheritance.

In the words of the ancient Celtic poet, "The body is a doorway to the soul." It's time to open that doorway, to listen to your body's whispers, and to reclaim the memories that have been hidden, even from yourself. You are not just a mind, but a body, a heart, and a soul, interconnected and interdependent. And it's time to remember that, to embody that, and to live from that place of deep wisdom, profound power, and sacred connection.
