There's a part of you that knows the ache of a past love still resonates within, a lingering frequency that refuses to fade. You've felt the weight of unseen threads, the energetic cords that bind you to what's been, and the exhaustion that comes with carrying the ghosts of relationships past.

## The Hidden Mechanism

This is where most people get it backwards: they think the pain of a past love is solely emotional, a product of the heart's longing. But the part they don't tell you is that these emotional wounds are also energetic imprints, patterns of vibration that your body remembers long after the relationship has ended. Ancient priestesses knew this as the "web of connections," a network of subtle energies that link us to others across time and space. Neuroscience now proves that our brains are wired to respond to these energetic cues, triggering memories and emotions that can feel overwhelming. You call it "still feeling the sting," but what's actually happening is that your body is resonating with the frequency of what's past, keeping you tethered to memories that no longer serve you. Try this: take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, imagine any tension or pain leaving your body, like autumn leaves rustling to the ground. Notice how your body responds to this simple act of release.

## Why You've Been Stuck

You've been doing what you thought was necessary to "move on" – distracting yourself, filling the void with new relationships or hobbies – because you thought that's what it meant to heal. But actually, this approach only serves to mask the symptoms, leaving the underlying energetic patterns intact. What you call "closure" is actually a form of energetic severing, a cutting of the cords that bind you to the past. The real challenge isn't in finding a new love or moving on; it's in releasing the energetic imprint of what's been, allowing yourself to transmute the pain into a deeper understanding of your own sovereignty. You've been trying to "let go" of the past, but what if the past is actually a doorway to your own embodiment, a chance to reclaim the parts of yourself that you've been holding onto out of fear or loyalty?

## The Real Method

The alchemy of cord cutting lies not in the physical act of severing ties, but in the subtle art of shifting your frequency. When you vibrate at a higher frequency, you become less resonant with the lower vibrational patterns of the past, allowing yourself to break free from the energetic cords that bind you. This is not about "getting over" someone or something; it's about embodying your own truth, recognizing that your body is a portal to the wisdom of your soul. The mechanism of cord cutting works on a soul level because it acknowledges that your body is an antenna, attuning to the frequencies that surround you. By intentionally shifting your vibration, you can begin to release the energetic imprints that no longer serve you, making space for a deeper sense of embodiment and sovereignty.

## Your Practice

**1. The Recognition**
Notice the physical sensations in your body when you think of a past love or relationship. Where do you feel the tension or pain? What memories arise? Allow yourself to observe these sensations without judgment, recognizing that your body is remembering the past in a way that's unique to you.

**2. The Transmutation**
Imagine a thread of light connecting you to the past love or relationship. As you inhale, imagine this thread beginning to glow with a soft, golden light. As you exhale, imagine this light expanding, filling any areas of tension or pain in your body. Repeat the phrase "I release the need to carry this" as you exhale, allowing the golden light to transmute the energetic imprint of the past.

**3. The Integration**
Take a few moments each day to embody the sensation of release, allowing yourself to feel the freedom and lightness that comes with cutting the cords to the past. Imagine yourself walking through a portal, leaving behind the weights and burdens of what's been. As you step into this new space, repeat the phrase "I am sovereign, I am free" to yourself, feeling the truth of these words resonating deep within your body.

The moment you stop trying to "get over" the past, you start becoming the embodiment of your own truth, recognizing that the unseen threads that once bound you are actually doorways to your own liberation. You're not releasing the past; you're remembering the freedom that's always been yours.
