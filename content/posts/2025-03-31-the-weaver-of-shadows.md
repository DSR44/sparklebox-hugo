## Weaver of Shadows ‚Äì A Poetic Tale of Becoming | day 7

In the hush of twilight, she works‚Äîsilent, unseen, ancient. The **Weaver of Shadows**, a mystical figure who transforms sorrow into silver thread, weaving the soft fabric of our inner landscapes. Today‚Äôs entry in the *‚Äú7 Days of Becoming‚Äù* series invites you into her quiet, poetic realm, where healing takes shape through memory, emotion, and light.

### 

In twilight's hush, where darkness reigns
A weaver works, with threads of pains
From every sorrow, every fear
She crafts a tapestry, both worn and dear

Her loom creaks slow, as moon's pale light
Dances upon the fabric bright
A silken web, with knots so fine
Reflecting life's own intricate design

With fingers deft, she weaves and tears
As shadows gather, through all the years
The whispers of the past, in every strand
Echoes of love, of joy, of pain's hand

In this dark art, she finds her way
A path that winds, through dawn's first ray
For in each thread, a tale is spun
Of trials faced, and triumphs won

But oh, how fragile is this fabric so fine!
How easily it frays, like the threads of time
Yet still, our weaver holds on tight
To every fiber, shining with morning light

What does she weave? What tale does she tell?
A reflection of life's own twisted spell?
Or perhaps, a path that's yet to be found?
Only she knows, in this weaving profound?
