#### *And then I put myself back together like a cosmic jewel.*

### 🌑 *Opening:*

> For years, I stood before reflections shaped by others.

> 
> 
> 
> Their words were like fingerprints on the glass:
*If only you were softer.*
*If only you were smaller.*
*If only you were less.*

> 
> 
> 
> The mirror never shattered.
But I did.

> 
> 
> 
> Every time I smiled when I wanted to scream.
Every time I made myself polite instead of powerful.
Every time I tried to earn love by editing myself into something palatable.

> 
> 
> 
> ### 🌕 *The Turning *
> 
> 
> 
> 
> It didn’t come like lightning.
There was no grand realization.

> 
> 
> 
> Just silence.
A kind I hadn’t sat with in a long time.

> 
> 
> 
> And in that silence, I had a choice:
stay where I was — or keep repeating the loop.

> 
> 
> 
> A loop I knew too well.
Same patterns, different faces.
The same soul, disguised in new bodies.

> 
> 
> 
> And I had to ask:
*What am I still feeding inside me
that keeps calling this back?*

> 
> 
> 
> It wasn’t about men.
It wasn’t even about love.

> 
> 
> 
> It was about the echo I carried.
The way I’d still let old voices whisper through me:
*You’re not enough.*
*You should be smaller.*
*Quieter.*

> 
> 
> 
> I had made myself believe that the world knew better than me.

> 
> 
> 
> But no more.
I looked in the mirror — not for beauty,
but for **truth.**
I tried to see myself like a stranger would.
No history. No projection. Just… a woman.
And she?
She was strong.
She was exquisite.
She deserved peace.

> 
> 
> 
> So I made a decision.
To stop letting the external rearrange my internal.
To stop shrinking for a world that thrives on my discomfort.

> 
> 
> 
> If I say I am beautiful,
If I say I am worthy,
Then so it is.

### 🔐 *The Lock Inside Me:*

> There is now a lock inside me.
A velvet box sealed tight.
And inside it — the truth I no longer negotiate:

> 
> 
> 
> 🗝 *I am beautiful.*
🗝 *I smell like moonlight and gold.*
🗝 *I move like honey on purpose.*
🗝 *I am everything.*
🗝 *I am the standard.*
🗝 *I am the garden — not the guest.*

> 
> 
> 
> And no man’s lack of vision will ever again define what is already divine.

### 🪞 *Closing Reflection:*

> So the next time someone tries to dim you with doubt,
remember the bee.

> 
> 
> 
> Tiny. Designed. Divine.
Necessary.

> 
> 
> 
> Perfection is not the absence of flaws —
It’s the **precise and intentional contribution of your energy** to the harmony of existence.

> 
> 
> 
> You are not here to be fixed.
You are here to be **remembered** — by yourself.

### 🌸 **Elvida’s Affirmation Set: The Sacred Shape of Me**

*Words to speak after you return to yourself.*

🔹 **I am not fine — I am flawlessly composed by design.**
*I am a deliberate note in the universe’s harmony.* 

🔹 **I no longer perform for love. I walk in the vibration of self-recognition.**

🔹 **My shape is not a negotiation. My form is not an apology. My presence is not a placeholder.**

🔹 **I was never meant to fit into anyone's ideal. I am the original pattern.**

🔹 **They cannot shatter me — I took back every piece and chose where they now belong.**

*If the mirror has ever betrayed you, let this be the page that hands it back.*
