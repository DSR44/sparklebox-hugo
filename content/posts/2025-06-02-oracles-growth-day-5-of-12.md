## ♌️ Leo — The Radiance Uncaged

🌞 *Oracle Growth Series | Dreamweaver Tales – Day 5*

### 🔥 **Tale: The Flame That Stopped Performing**

In the center of a thousand golden mirrors, there stood a being known as **The Radiant One**.

Crowned not by others, but by the fire within, they had long walked the path of **brightness**, casting light so strong that others mistook it for power. Applause followed them like shadows at noon — never far, never real.

For a time, they lived to be seen.

But one night, under a moonless sky, when the mirrors all cracked and the crowd fell silent, something ancient stirred within them — a quiet warmth without need, a **light that didn’t burn to be watched**.

So they walked away from the stage, into the wild, sunlit unknown. There, without audience or echo, they stood before a still pond. And for the first time, the reflection looked back without asking for approval. It simply glowed.

They placed their crown on the earth. Not to discard it — but to root it.

And from the core of their chest — not their face, not their fame — the light rose again. This time, softer. Truer. Endless.

*"I do not shine to be seen,"* they whispered.
*"I shine because I am."*

### 🌌 **Portal Vision: Q2–Q3 Energy for Leo**

On the other side: not applause — but **silence, sacred and whole**.
A vision pulses from deep within the light.

✨ You see yourself glowing from alignment, not performance.
✨ You feel your energy returning to what matters — soul-led creation.
✨ You no longer shine to be seen. You shine because you are.

### ✨ **Affirmations for Leo (2025: Becoming the Radiance)**

🌞 I honor my creative fire, but I do not burn for approval.
🌞 I allow presence, not pressure, to guide me.
🌞 I trust my radiance to attract what aligns with my truth.
🌞 My light is not loud — it is legendary.

### 🕯️ **Oracle’s Gift**
